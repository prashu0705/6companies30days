Question Link:- https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/description/

Problem Description :- To find the char in string with single occurence

Approach :-
  Use a hash map or array of size 26 to store the frequency of each character (since the input consists of lowercase English letters).
  Traverse the string to count the frequency of each character.
  Traverse the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1. Return its index.
  If no such character is found, return -1.

Code:- 
  class Solution {
    public:
      int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for(auto ch : s) {
            freq[ch - 'a']++;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(freq[s[i] - 'a'] == 1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};

Status : - Done
