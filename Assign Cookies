Approach:
Sort Both Arrays:
  Sort g (children's greed factors) and s (cookie sizes) in ascending order.
Use Two Pointers:
  Pointer i for g (children), and j for s (cookies).
Iterate Through Arrays:
  If the current cookie (s[j]) satisfies the current child (g[i]), increment both i and j (child is satisfied).
  Otherwise, increment j only (try a larger cookie for the same child).
Count Satisfied Children:
  Track the count of satisfied children when g[i] <= s[j].
Return the Count:
  Stop when either all children are satisfied or all cookies are used. Return the count.

Code: 
  class Solution {
  public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        int gSize = g.size();
        int sSize = s.size();
        sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while(i < gSize && j < sSize) {
            if(g[i] <= s[j]) {
                count++;
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

Status: Done
