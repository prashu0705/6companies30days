Problem Description :- 
  In this circular game, n friends numbered from 1 to n stand in a circle. In the first round, we start counting from friend 1 and eliminate the k-th friend. In each subsequent round, counting starts from the friend immediately clockwise to the one just eliminated, and the k-th friend is eliminated again. This process repeats until only one person remains.

Algorithm:-
  Initialize a queue of size n, where the elements are labeled 1 to n.
  While more than 1 friend is remaining
    Remove the next k-1 friends and re-add them to the queue.
    Remove the next friend (the k-th friend that should be eliminated in the game)
  Return the value of the last friend remaining

Code :-
  class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        // Initialize queue with n friends
        queue<int> circle;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            circle.push(i);
        }

        // Perform eliminations while more than 1 player remains
        while (circle.size() > 1) {
            // Process the first k-1 friends without eliminating them
            for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
                circle.push(circle.front());
                circle.pop();
            }
            // Eliminate the k-th friend
            circle.pop();
        }

        return circle.front();
    }
};

Status : Done
